\title{Downscale a wind rose raster data to higher spatial resolution}
\usage{
downscale(x, fact, method = "bilinear")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{wind_rose}

\item{fact}{a single integer giving the factor by which to disaggregate the data; this is passed to \link[terra]{disagg}.}

\item{method}{disaggregation method; either "near" or "bilinear'; see \link[terra]{disagg} for details.}
}
\value{
A higher resolution version of x
}
\description{
This function disaggregates a wind_rose raster, interpolating it to higher spatial resolution and then
adjusting values to maintain correct connectivity units. Downscaling is useful when connectivity is to
be modeled between sites that are separated by few or no grid cells.
}
\details{
Larger values of \code{fact} create higher-resolution wind surfaces, which improves connectivity estimates
between nearby sites. The trade-off is computational cost.
