\title{Weight a windrose conductance raster}
\usage{
weight_conductance(rose, w)
}
\arguments{
\item{rose}{A raster stack created using \code{windrose_rasters()}.}

\item{w}{A raster layer with values to be multiplied by \code{rose}. For example, supplying a layer with 1 for land and 0.1 for water would downweight connectivity over water by 90%. This layer must have the same spatial properties as the windrose raster.}
}
\value{
A version of \code{rose}, with conductance values weighted by \code{w}.
}
\description{
This function adjusts the conductance values in a windrose raster, multiplying them by the values of a secondary raster data set \code{w},
which can be used to integrate non-wind factors into a wind connectivity analysis.
}
\details{
As a hypothetical example, to incorporate a decreased but nonzero likelihood of dispersal over inhospitable areas, \code{w} could be a raster layer with 0.1 indicating water or mountains and 1.0 elsewhere.
