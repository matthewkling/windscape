\title{Convert asymmetric pairwise matrix to symmetrical matrix of pairwise means}
\usage{
pairwise_means(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A square matrix with entries representing directional edge weights between pairs of nodes.}
}
\value{
A symmetrical square matrix the same size as \code{x}, with values representing the pairwise means of directional flows in \code{x}.
}
\description{
This function produces a symmetrical matrix with values representing the pairwise means of directional flows in an asymmetric in put matrix.
The output can be used in tests about the strength of direction-agnostic connectivity among nodes in a data set (e.g. the "isolation" hypothesis; Kling and Ackerly (2021)).
