wind_field_ts(x, order)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Multi-layer \code{SpatRaster} with layers containing u and v wind components, or
an object like a file path that can be converted to a \code{SpatRaster}. Note that
raster data must be in lat-long coordinates.}

\item{order}{Either \code{"uuvv"}, the default indicating `x` has all u components
followed by all v components, or \code{"uuvv"}, indicating the u and v components
of `x` are alternating.}
