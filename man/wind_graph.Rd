\title{Build a wind connectivity graph}
\usage{
wind_graph(x, direction = "downwind", wrap = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class `wind_rose`.}

\item{direction}{Either "downwind" (the default) or "upwind", indicating whether outbound or inbound wind conductance should be computed, respectively.}

\item{wrap}{Should the left and right edges of the raster be connected? Default is FALSE. Set to TRUE if, for example, `x` is a global raster where -180 and 180 are equivalent longitudes.}
}
\value{
a `wind_graph` object consisting of a gdistance \link[gdistance]{Transition-class} object and additional metadata
}
\description{
This function constructs a landscape connectivity graph from a windrose raster stack.
