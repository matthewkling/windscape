\usage{
generate_particles(
  x,
  n = 1000,
  sample = "random",
  equalarea = TRUE,
  epsg = 8857,
  expand = 0.25
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A wind_field object.}

\item{n}{Positive integer giving the total number of particles in the grid. If \code{sample = "random"} the result
will have this exact number of particles, while if \code{sample = "grid"} it will be approximate.}

\item{sample}{Sampling scheme, either "random" (the default) to generate points at random locations, or "grid" to
generate points on a regular grid.}

\item{equalarea}{Logical indicating whether to generate points on an equal area basis (TRUE, the default) or in
lon-lat space (FALSE, which over-samples higher-latitude regions).}

\item{epsg}{EPSG code for the projection in which to generate points. Only used if \code{equalarea = TRUE} and
\code{sample = "grid"}. The default is \code{8857}, the Equal Area projection.}

\item{expand}{Proportion by which to expand the bounding box around \code{x} after projection, to capture the full
domain in projected space. Only used if \code{equalarea = TRUE} and \code{sample = "grid"}.}
}
\value{
A two-column matrix of x (longitude) and y (latitude) values, with a row for each particle.
}
\description{
Initialize a set of particle locations for use in \link{particle_flow}.
