\title{Summarize a time series of wind fields into a wind rose}
\usage{
wind_rose(x, trans = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data set of class `wind_series`.}

\item{trans}{Either a function, or a positive number indicating the power to raise windspeeds to; see details.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to `terra::app`, e.g. 'filename'.}
}
\value{
A \code{wind_rose} object. This is an 8-layer raster stack, where each layer is wind conductance from
  the focal cell to one of its neighbors (clockwise starting in the SW).
  If input windspeeds are in m/s and `trans = 1`, values are in (1 / hours)
}
\description{
This function converts a \code{wind_field_ts} into a \code{wind_rose} object
summarizing the distribution of wind speed and direction observations in each grid
cell. The result is a set of eight raster layers giving the average wind conductance
toward each of a cell's 'queen' neighbors.
}
\details{
The `trans` parameter defines the transformation function used to convert wind speed
into conductance. If a numeric value is supplied, the function speed^trans is used.
A value of trans = 0 will ignore speed, assigning weights based on direction only;
trans = 1 assumes conductance is proportional to windspeed, trans = 2 assumes it's
proportional to aerodynamic drag, and trans = 3 assumes it's proportional to force.
Any intermediate value can also be used. Any function that transforms a numeric
vector can also be supplied; for example, to model seed dispersal for a species
that only releases seeds when winds exceed 10 m/s, we could specify a threshold
function `trans = function(x){x[x < 10] <- 0; return(x)}`.
