\title{Pairwise wind distances between points}
\usage{
least_cost_distance(graph, sites, adjust = TRUE, rate = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A \link{wind_graph}.}

\item{sites}{A two-column matrix of point coordinates.}

\item{adjust}{Whether to scale results to correct for discrepancies between point-to-point
distances and cell-to-cell distances. Default is TRUE.}

\item{rate}{Whether to return values as "rates" instead of the default "cost distances". Rates
are the inverse of cost distances, representing flow rather than travel time.}
}
\value{
A square matrix of wind travel times.
}
\description{
Calculate pairwise wind cost-distances (e.g. travel times) or flow rates (the inverse of cost-distances)
among a set of sites, using the least cost path algorithm. This function is a wrapper around
\link[gdistance]{costDistance}.
