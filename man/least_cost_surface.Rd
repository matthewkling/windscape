\title{Accumulated wind cost surface}
\usage{
least_cost_surface(graph, sites, rate = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{graph}{A \link{wind_graph}.}

\item{sites}{A two-column matrix of point coordinates.}

\item{rate}{Whether to return values as "rates" instead of the default "cost distances". Rates
are the inverse of cost distances, representing flow rather than travel time.}
}
\value{
A SpatRaster of wind connectivity values.
}
\description{
Calculate the accumulated wind cost-distance (e.g. travel times) or flow rate (the inverse of cost-distance)
from one or more sites to every grid cell across the domain, using the least cost path algorithm. This
function is a wrapper around \link[gdistance]{accCost}.
