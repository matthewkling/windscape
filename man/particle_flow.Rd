\title{Simulate the flow of particles across a wind field}
\usage{
particle_flow(
  x,
  p,
  n_iter = 100,
  scale = 0.01,
  wrap = "neither",
  direction = "both",
  ignore_speed = FALSE,
  sf = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{wind_field} object created by \link{wind_field}.}

\item{p}{Either a two-column lon-lat matrix of initial particle locations (e.g. produced by \link{generate_particles}),
or an integer giving the number of particles to initialize (in which case, provide additional arguments to
\link{generate_particles} in \code{...}).}

\item{n_iter}{Positive integer giving the number of iterations to simulate.}

\item{scale}{A multiplier to convert step sizes from velocity (in whatever then native units of \code{x} are) to degrees
lon-lat. Smaller scale values yield smoother but shorter particle trails over a given number of iterations.}

\item{wrap}{Either "vertical", "horizontal", "both", or "neither" (the default).}

\item{direction}{Either "downwind", "upwind", or "both" (the default).}

\item{ignore_speed}{Logical: if TRUE, only direction is considered and all particles are displaced the same distance. Default is FALSE.}

\item{sf}{Logical indicating whether the output shoudl be break_trailted as an `sf` object instead of the default data frame.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to \link{generate_particles}, used only if \code{p} is an integer.}
}
\value{
If `sf = FALSE`, a data frame representing particle positions over time. Variables include "p" (the id number of the particle),
   "x" (longitude), "y" (latitude), "v" (velocity, in the same units as the input wind data), and "t" (the iteration
   number, which is positive for downwind and negative for upwind; arrange by this variable when plotting). If `sf = TRUE`,
   a simple feature collection of linestrings (in this case, velocity is not included, and the iteration index is included
   as the third coordination dimension).
}
\description{
This function simulates the movement of particles over a wind field. At each iteration, particles
are displaced in accordance with the direction and speed of the local wind conditions.
