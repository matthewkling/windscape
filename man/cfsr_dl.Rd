\title{Download wind data from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR)}
\usage{
cfsr_dl(
  variable = "wnd10m",
  years = 1979,
  months = 1,
  days = 1,
  xlim = c(260, 270),
  ylim = c(40, 50)
)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable}{Name of the CFSR wind variable to download. Options include "wnd10m" (the default, representing wind speed
10 m above the ground), as well as "wnd1000", "wnd850", "wnd700", "wnd500", and "wnd200" (representing higher altitudes,
with the numbers indicating pressure levels in hPa).}

\item{years}{Integer vector representing the historic year(s) for which data are to be accessed, in the range 1979-2010.}

\item{months}{Integer vector representing the month(s) for which data are to be accessed, in the range 1-12.}

\item{days}{Integer vector representing day(s) for which data is to be requested, in the range 0-31.}

\item{xlim}{Vector of length 2, giving longitudinal limits of the data to download, in the range 0 to 360.}

\item{ylim}{Vector of length 2, giving latitudinal limits of the data to download, in the range -90 to 90.}
}
\value{
A list containing u and v components of the wind field, each as a SpatRaster with a layer for each hour of each requested date.
}
\description{
This function downloads hourly CFSR wind data from the NCAR THREDDS server, for one or more historic dates, within a spatial bounding box.
Data for all factorial combinations of 'years', 'months', and 'days' are downloaded and combined.
