\title{Summary statistics for a windshed}
\usage{
ws_summarize(x, origin, radius = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{SpatRaster representing wind accessibility, with higher values indicating greater accessibility.
(For example, this could be the output of `random_walk()`, or `least_cost_surface(..., rate = TRUE)`.)}

\item{origin}{Coordinates of center point (matrix with 2 columns and 1 row).}

\item{radius}{Optional windshed radius, in km; cells farther from the origin than this will be excluded
from the summary statistics.}
}
\value{
A named vector of summary statistics:
\itemize{
 \item{"centroid_x": }{Longitude of windshed "centroid". The centroid is the mean of all lon-lat coordinates, weighed by the wind accessibility values in \code{x}.}
 \item{"centroid_y": }{Latitude of windshed centroid.}
 \item{"centroid_distance": }{Distance from origin to windshed centroid, in km.}
 \item{"centroid_bearing": }{Bearing from origin to windshed centroid, in degrees.}
 \item{"windshed_distance: }{Mean distance from origin, in km. This is the average distance from the origin to every grid cell, weighted by accessibility.}
 \item{"windshed_bearing": }{Mean bearing from origin, in degrees. This is the circular-mean bearing from the origin to every other grid cell, weighted by accessibility.}
 \item{"windshed_isotropy": }{Circular standard deviation of the bearing from the origin to every other grid cell, weighted by accessibility. Low values indicate that accessible sites are concentrated in a narrow range of compass directions, while high values indicate a wide distribution of directions. The range of possible values is 0-1.}
 \item{"windshed_size": }{Mean accessibility. This is the average of all accessibility values, weighted to correct for grid distortions. Higher values indicate landscapes with greater overall wind accessibility.}
 \item{"windshed_landarea": }{A realative measure of the land area covered by grid cells with nonzero wind accessibility.}
}

\description{
A "windshed" is a raster layer representing upwind or downwind connectivity for a given point. This
function computes a range of statistics summarizing a windshed, such as the size, centroid location,
and isotropy of the wind accessibility surface. It is useful primarily for comparing the windshed
properties of multiple different sites.
