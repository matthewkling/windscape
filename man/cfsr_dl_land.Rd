\title{Download land-water raster from the Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR)}
\usage{
cfsr_dl_land(xlim = c(260, 270), ylim = c(40, 50))
}
\arguments{
\item{xlim}{Vector of length 2, giving longitudinal limits of the data to download, in the range 0 to 360.}

\item{ylim}{Vector of length 2, giving latitudinal limits of the data to download, in the range -90 to 90.}
}
\value{
A SpatRaster layer with 1 indicating land and 0 indicating water.
}
\description{
This function downloads a CFSR land-water raster layer from the NCAR THREDDS server, for an area specified by a spatial bounding box.
}
\details{
(Actually, since CFSR does not publish a land layer per se, this function downloads a soil temperature layer for an arbitrary date and classifies areas with data as land and no data as water.)
