The `windscape` R package models landscape connectivity by wind dispersal. It includes functions to help you import wind data, model wind diffusion times across a region, visualize the results, and test statistical relationships between wind and your ecological data.


### Installation

`devtools::install_github("matthewkling/windscape")`


### Usage

Here's a demonstration of a workflow to create a map of estimated wind travel times from a particular location. See the package vignette for details and other functionality.

```{r example, eval = T, message = F, warning = F}
library(windscape)
library(tidyverse)

site <- vect(matrix(c(-105, 40), 1)) # lat-lon coordinates of a focal site

rast(system.file("extdata/wind.tif", package = "windscape")) %>% # load wind time series rasters
      wind_field(order = "uuvv") %>% # convert to a formal wind field object
      wind_rose() %>% # summarize into wind rose conductance object
      wind_graph("downwind") %>% # format as connectivity graph
      least_cost_surface(site) %>% # calculate least cost path from coordinates
      plot(main = "outbound wind travel time (hours)") # plot map of travel times

points(site, col = "red") # add origin location to map
```
